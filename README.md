## **Adventure Quest:**
*A Code Louisville project*


This project contains a small "choose your own adventure" type story
with branching paths. There is also an About and FAQ section included.


## **Getting Started**

Once you've downloaded this repository, please open with your choise of code editor and choose the 
index.html file to open with live server.

* This function has been tested to work with the Visual Studio Code program.


## **Feature Requirements Used and Their Locations**

* A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu *(JavaScript/menu.js Script is used in Line 24 of all html files.)*
* Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout *(media.css accomplished this on Line 6 and affects the about.html file.)*
* Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action. *(JavaScript/story.js + story1.js + story2.js all accomplish this by triggering an alert when certain buttons are pressed in the storyArc html files.)*
* Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site. *(JavaScript/luckNum.js displays an alert with a random number between 1 and 99 when the button on Line 42 is pressed in the faq.html file.)*
